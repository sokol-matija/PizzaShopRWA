Git Usage

- Use the following **prefixes** for commit messages, followed by a **colon** and a **space**:

  - `fix` — for bug fixes
  - `feat` — for new features
  - `perf` — for performance improvements
  - `docs` — for documentation changes
  - `style` — for formatting changes
  - `refactor` — for code refactoring
  - `test` — for adding missing tests
  - `chore` — for routine tasks

- When determining the commit message prefix, pick the most **relevant** option from the list above.

-  Use **lowercase** for all commit messages.

- If the change is not self-explanatory, include a **bullet list of changes** after a blank line below the summary.
