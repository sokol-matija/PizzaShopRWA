# Interactive Questions - Travel Organization System Understanding

## Purpose
This document contains questions to help you understand the Travel Organization System better through active thinking and discussion.

---

## **1. Architecture & Design Questions**

### **System Overview**
**Q1.1:** Can you explain in your own words what this Travel Organization System does? What are the main business processes it supports?

**Q1.2:** Who are the main users of this system? What can each type of user do?

**Q1.3:** What's the difference between a "trip" and a "destination" in this system?

### **Dual Application Architecture**
**Q2.1:** The system has both a WebAPI and WebApp. Why do you think they chose this approach instead of just having one application?

**Q2.2:** What are the benefits of having separate API and web applications?

**Q2.3:** How do the WebAPI and WebApp communicate with each other?

### **Authentication Strategy**
**Q3.1:** The system uses JWT for the API and Cookies for the web app. Can you explain why different authentication methods were chosen for each?

**Q3.2:** What would happen if they used the same authentication method for both applications?

**Q3.3:** How does a user's login session work when they use the WebApp to access API data?

## **2. Database & Data Flow Questions**

### **Database Design**
**Q4.1:** Looking at the 7 main entities (Users, Destinations, Trips, Guides, TripGuides, TripRegistrations, Logs), can you trace through a typical user journey?

Example: "User registers → User browses destinations → User books a trip → ..."

**Q4.2:** Why is there a separate `TripGuides` table instead of just putting the guide information directly in the `Trips` table?

**Q4.3:** What does the `TripRegistrations` table represent? How is it different from just having a "bookings" table?

### **Service Layer Pattern**
**Q5.1:** The system uses Service Layer Pattern instead of Repository Pattern. Based on the documentation, why do you think this choice was made?

**Q5.2:** What are the trade-offs between Service Layer and Repository patterns?

**Q5.3:** How does the data flow from the database to the user interface? Can you trace the path?

---

## **3. Security & Authorization Questions**

### **Authorization Levels**
**Q6.1:** The system has three authorization levels: Public, Authenticated, and Admin. Can you give examples of what each level can do?

**Q6.2:** Why do you think some trip information is public while other operations require authentication?

**Q6.3:** How does the system prevent a regular user from accessing admin functions?

### **Password Security**
**Q7.1:** How are passwords stored in the database? Why is this approach secure?

**Q7.2:** What happens when a user wants to change their password? What security measures are in place?

**Q7.3:** How does the JWT token contain user information? What happens if someone steals a token?

---

## **4. Technical Implementation Questions**

### **AJAX Implementation**
**Q8.1:** The documentation mentions AJAX is implemented in some areas but not others. Where is AJAX used and why?

**Q8.2:** What's the difference between using AJAX and traditional form submissions? When would you use each?

**Q8.3:** Why might AJAX pagination on the trips page be missing? What would be needed to implement it?

### **Image Management**
**Q9.1:** The system integrates with Unsplash API for images. Why use an external service instead of storing images locally?

**Q9.2:** How does the image caching system work? What problems does it solve?

**Q9.3:** What happens if the Unsplash API is down? How does the system handle this?

---

## **5. Configuration & Deployment Questions**

### **Environment Configuration**
**Q10.1:** What's the difference between development and production configuration? Why are they separate?

**Q10.2:** How are secrets (like database passwords) handled differently in development vs production?

**Q10.3:** What does the token replacement pattern `#{VARIABLE_NAME}#` achieve in production configuration?

### **Deployment Strategy**
**Q11.1:** The system is deployed to Azure. What are the benefits of cloud deployment vs traditional hosting?

**Q11.2:** How does the system handle different environments (dev, staging, production)?

**Q11.3:** What would happen if the database connection string was hardcoded instead of using configuration?

---

## **6. Missing Features & Improvements**

### **Current Limitations**
**Q12.1:** The documentation mentions some features are missing (like AJAX pagination). Why might these have been left out?

**Q12.2:** What would be the impact of adding AutoMapper to the system? Is it worth the complexity?

**Q12.3:** What are the trade-offs of the current manual mapping approach vs automated mapping?

### **Scalability Considerations**
**Q13.1:** How would this system handle 1000 concurrent users? What might break first?

**Q13.2:** What database optimizations are already in place? What additional ones might be needed?

**Q13.3:** How does the stateless JWT approach help with scaling?

---

## **7. Code Quality & Best Practices**

### **Error Handling**
**Q14.1:** How does the system handle different types of errors (validation, database, external API)?

**Q14.2:** What happens when the Unsplash API returns an error? How is this handled gracefully?

**Q14.3:** How are application errors logged and monitored?

### **Testing Strategy**
**Q15.1:** What types of testing would be most important for this system?

**Q15.2:** How does the Service Layer pattern make testing easier?

**Q15.3:** What would you test first if you were writing tests for this system?

---

## **8. Business Logic Questions**

### **Trip Management**
**Q16.1:** How does the system handle trip capacity? What happens when a trip is full?

**Q16.2:** Can the same guide be assigned to multiple trips? How is this managed?

**Q16.3:** What happens when a user cancels a trip registration? How is this handled?

### **User Experience**
**Q17.1:** How does the system provide a good user experience for browsing trips?

**Q17.2:** What features help users find the trips they're interested in?

**Q17.3:** How does the admin interface differ from the regular user interface?

## **9. Integration & External Services**

### **Unsplash Integration**
**Q18.1:** Why was Unsplash chosen over other image services? What are the benefits?

**Q18.2:** How does the caching strategy reduce API calls to Unsplash?

**Q18.3:** What would be the fallback strategy if Unsplash became unavailable?

### **Database Integration**
**Q19.1:** Why use Entity Framework Core instead of raw SQL queries?

**Q19.2:** What are the benefits of the "Database-First Hybrid" approach?

**Q19.3:** How does the system handle database migrations and schema changes?

---

## **10. Performance & Optimization**

### **Current Optimizations**
**Q20.1:** What performance optimizations are already implemented in the system?

**Q20.2:** How does the async/await pattern improve performance?

**Q20.3:** What role does caching play in system performance?

### **Future Improvements**
**Q21.1:** What would be the next performance improvements you'd implement?

**Q21.2:** How could the database queries be optimized further?

**Q21.3:** What monitoring would you add to track system performance?
